# Overview
The Sleep Disorder Prediction App is a web-based application built with Streamlit that leverages a Random Forest model to predict sleep disorders (e.g., Insomnia, Sleep Apnea, or No Disease) based on the Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset. This app provides an interactive interface to explore the dataset, visualize exploratory data analysis (EDA), train the model, and view prediction results. It is designed to help users understand factors affecting sleep health and make informed predictions.

- **Dataset**: Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset (374 rows, 13 columns) with demographics, sleep metrics, lifestyle factors, and health indicators.
- **Model**: Random Forest Classifier with pre-trained weights and preprocessing pipelines.
- **Features**: Home overview, EDA visualizations, model training with user input, and performance results.
